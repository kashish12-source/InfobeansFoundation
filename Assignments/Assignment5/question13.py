# Find common elements in three sorted arrays.
# Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.
# Note: can you take care of the duplicates without using any additional Data Structure?
# Example 1:
# Input:
# n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
# n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
# n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
# Output: 20 80
# Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only
# common elements in A, B and C
a = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80]
b = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100]
c = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]
for i in range(len(a)):
    for j in range(len(b)):
        for k in range(len(c)):
            if a[i]==b[j]==c[k]:
                
                print(a[i],end=" ")
